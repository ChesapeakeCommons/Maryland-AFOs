# Maryland-AFOs
The following repository contains attribute information on Maryland Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs).  Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) maintains these data through their Public AFO Search Tool, however our team at Chesapeake Commons works to ensure farm geographies and data are structured in an open format.  Attributes include the following:

* Farm Name
* AI Number
* Farm Designation
* Farm Address
* Farm County
* Primary Animal Type


Due to unclear data managment protocols by the state, our team only maintains these data on <strong>registered</strong> AFOs and operations with Certifications of Conformance.  Be sure to view commit history for the data set updates.
